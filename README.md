# Nilan graphics
Home Assistant: Graphics for Nilan ventilation (use with Lovelace). 

The graphics shows the speed and direction of the air-flow, and the color changes according to states of: Cooling/Heating/Standby. I have the Nilan VPL15, which is only for air-heating/cooling (no water-heating). You might need to adjust the yaml-file if you have other states.

Animations are made with MS Powerpoint. Export from Powerpoint to a gif files and refine these using e.g. Photohshop.
All files made for Powerpoint and Photoshop are included. Feel free to use and make your own customization.

Put image files in the www-folder in Home Assistant in a sub-dir called "nilan". Add the suggested "lovelace.yaml" code in your own "ui-lovelace.yaml" file.
